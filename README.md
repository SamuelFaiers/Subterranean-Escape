# Subterranean-Escape
A video game I created with two others using Unity engine and C#.

My roles:
- Design and develop the user interface
- Create some of the 3D assets
- Design and develop gameplay features such as climbing

Scripts I wrote:
- Climb.cs
- Interact.cs (specifically the 'CollectKey()' function)
- PauseGame.cs
- Timer.cs
- UI.cs
- UIControlller.cs
